# Advanced SQL Queries â€“ Join Practice

This project explores complex SQL JOINs including:
- `INNER JOIN`: for records with matches in both tables.
- `LEFT JOIN`: for all records from one table and matched records from another.
- `FULL OUTER JOIN`: for all records from both tables, matched or not.

All queries are in `complex_joins.sql`.
